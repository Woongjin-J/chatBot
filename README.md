# chatBot

ChatBot is a program that receives request message in speech and respond it in speech as well.
It currently supports weather condition search function, home automation to turn on/off the light (it can also change the light into green),
and also BingSearch function that either returns the search result on current page or redirect to specified link.

Before each command, you need to say 'hey, computer' or 'computer' for it to start recognize the actual request. 
(instruction is also displayed on the input window)


# Weather Search

You can specify the day and the location of the weather you want to know. You can also ask if there's any weather advisory.
It can retrieve weather information up to 5 days ago and 7 days after the current date. 


# Home Automation

You can turn on both lights either together or separately. Lights can be swithched between green and white color.
